# SwiftUI Recipe App

A simple app for searching web recipes and creating own ones. The app uses SwiftUI framework and [Edamam's Recipe Search API](https://developer.edamam.com/edamam-recipe-api).

### Quick API setup
**Note**: you need to have Edamam account with your own credentials in order to send requests. 

Create [XCode config file](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/adding-a-build-configuration-file-to-your-project),
add to the file `APP_ID=YOUR_EDAMAM_APP_ID` and `APP_KEYS=YOUR_EDAMAM_APP_KEY` and then add this config to your project info, debug and release.
